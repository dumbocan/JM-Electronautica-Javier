app to follow the workflow in a boat workshop

Welcome to my firs PHP WEB APP,Im a self-learning man and I do this APP to help me with my daily job in pleasure boats.
I start to understand the MVC and POO coding, so may be a lot of bullshit and faults in the code, nut i'm improving it.
My plan is when I finish all the coding, i'll pass everything to Laravel with all the things acording to safety and UI.

You have a database of clients, boats, worksheets, materials database, and invoices, all in one.
Is in plain php, using a MVC , and POO.
I just used HTML, PHP, a litle CSS and a mysql database.

I'm allready working to finish the WEB APP, so is not finished yet.

installation:

Clone the repository into your www folder of your system, I use Laragon, copy the database with PHP myadmin. 
The admin user name is admin@admin
And password admin

I will apreciate some feedback from someone who knows clean code, because in my brain I have the feeling that I wrote a lot of Smellcode.
Thank you.
